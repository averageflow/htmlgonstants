# htmlgonstants

Useful constants to be added to any of your projects, reflecting the HTML5 API's attributes.
In order to write cleaner code when working with HTML, and also with [gomponents](https://github.com/maragudk/gomponents), I have created some exported constants that can be used by everyone using this project. 
This avoids typos, repetition and ensures a consistent usage of attribute values.
